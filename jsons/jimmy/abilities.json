The song can be accompanied with a <b>Motif</b> and is set to a <span class=\"item\"><span>ability</span>Time signature</span>.<br>The song is played with one beat equaling one turn.  A beat is an ability that can only be performed during a song.  Beats have one of four types: <ul><li>Sharp</li><li>Flat</li><li>Natural</li><li>Rest</li></ul>Beats are played in a <b>Measure</b>, depending on the <span class=\"item\"><span>ability</span>Time signature</span>.  Certain beats can only be played if they follow a particular beat type, or fall at a particular point in the measure.<br>A measure is a pattern of a particular number of beats, determined by the chosen <span class=\"item\"><span>ability</span>Time signature</span> for the song.  For example, if a 4/4 measure is chosen, every four beats the measure starts over. The song needs to be carefully considered to ensure it maintains proper rhythm and theme.  Playing the right beats in sequence can provide bonuses.  If a beat is not played on a turn, the turn is considered a <b>Rest</b>.  If two rests are played in sequence, the song is ended early.<br>If a song is ended early, you must use <span class=\"item\"><span>ability</span>Temperament</span> to begin the next song.  Certain <b>Composition dynamics</b> like <span class=\"item\"><span>ability</span>Outro</span> can end a song properly instead of early.  If a song is ended properly, the next song can begin by using this ability."
